The German language knows two versions of plain language: Einfache Sprache (Simple German) and [Leichte Sprache](https://leichte-sprache.de/), the latter being controlled by the _Netzwerk Leichte Sprache_.
The code was written using python version 3.10.4.\ 
The linguistic data from 2023, because the newst data is hard to be found.
All python packages needed to run the code can be found in the "requirements" file and installed using
`pip install -r requirements`.
I recommend using a virtualenv.
- [spacy.io](https://spacy.io/) python library for natural language processing supporting a plethora of languages, including [German](https://spacy.io/models/de)
